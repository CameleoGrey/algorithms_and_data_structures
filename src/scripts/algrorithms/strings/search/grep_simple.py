The grep command in Linux uses a combination of string-matching algorithms optimized for different use cases. Here's a breakdown of the key algorithms and techniques employed:

Primary Algorithms in GNU grep:

Boyer-Moore Algorithm (for fixed-string patterns with -F):
Used when searching for literal strings (no regex)
Implements both the bad-character and good-suffix heuristics
Provides sub-linear time complexity (can skip portions of text)

Aho-Corasick Algorithm (for multiple fixed strings with -f):
Used when searching for multiple patterns simultaneously
Builds a finite state machine from all patterns
Processes text in a single pass (O(n) time)
Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA):
Used for basic regular expressions
Pre-compiles regex into a state machine
Guarantees O(n) search time after preprocessing

Backtracking Regex Matcher:
Used for complex regex patterns with backreferences
Based on Henry Spencer's regex implementation
Can exhibit exponential time in worst cases

Key Optimizations in Modern grep:
mmap() for File Handling:
Memory-maps files for faster access
Avoids repeated read() system calls

Line Buffering:
Processes input line-by-line
Enables early termination when -m (max-count) is reached

Locale Optimization:
Fast path for ASCII-only text
Special handling for Unicode when needed

Parallel Processing (in some implementations):
Multithreaded search for large files

Performance Characteristics:
Best case: O(n/m) with Boyer-Moore (can skip large portions)
Worst case: O(n*m) with complex backreferences
Typical case: O(n) for most practical patterns

Modern GNU grep (as found in most Linux distributions) is highly optimized and will automatically 
select the most efficient algorithm based on the pattern type and input size. 
This is why it outperforms naive implementations even when processing large files.
